This tool uses AI to assist in document triage. For best results:
- **Be specific**: Ask "Compare arbitration clause" or "Spot unusual indemnity term"
- **Context matters**: Mention contract type or jurisdiction if relevant
- **AI is not a lawyer**: Always review important outputs yourself.

### üîê Confidentiality & Privacy Assurances
- **Zero Retention**: PDFs are not stored after your session ends.
- **Stateless AI**: No chat history is linked to you or reused.
